In classical programming languages, classes are very different than instances of that class. Therefore the methods of a class are different from the instances of that class.

JavaScript instances are created using a constructor. This can be any function, even if it may not look like it. This is different from a true classical language, where the class is a special kind of object that creates new instances.

JavaScript defines the behavior of instances by using prototypes.
